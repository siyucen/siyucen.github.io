## Welcome to My Pages
I am an undergraduate student in [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/) (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China. I am interested in geometry, analysis and applied math, mainly topology data analysis and numerical computation. This webpage will share some notes in the lectures and seminars I am taking.
